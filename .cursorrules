## Ralph File Management

When working with Ralph documentation files, use these commands:

### CLI Commands (Chainable, Recommended for Automation)

```bash
# Normalize files
just normalize-ralph

# Validate consistency
just validate-ralph

# Heal files with prompt
just heal-ralph "your healing prompt here"
just heal-ralph --prompt-file prompts/heal-request.md
just heal-ralph --dry-run "preview changes"

# Clean session
just clean-ralph
```

## File Discovery

Ralph files are discovered dynamically:
- Core files: `@fix_plan.md`, `specs/requirements.md`, `PROMPT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- All `prompts/*.md` files (automatically found)
- No hardcoded file lists - adapts to project structure
