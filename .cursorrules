# Cursor Rules for runi

> **Architectural patterns have moved to `.claude/skills/runi-architecture/SKILL.md`** for shared access across Cursor and Claude Code. See that file for event-driven architecture, loose coupling, MCP integration, ports & adapters, color/elevation layering, and all component patterns.

## Ralph File Management

When working with Ralph documentation files, use these commands:

### CLI Commands (Chainable, Recommended for Automation)

```bash
# Normalize files
just normalize-ralph

# Validate consistency
just validate-ralph
```

## File Discovery

Ralph files are discovered dynamically:

- Core files: `@fix_plan.md`, `specs/requirements.md`, `PROMPT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- All `prompts/*.md` files (automatically found)
- No hardcoded file lists - adapts to project structure

**Planning Documents:** Strategic planning documents are in a separate repository accessed via MCP tools. Use the runi Planning MCP (server from `.mcp.json`, e.g. `runi-Planning`) with tools `process_doc` (single-doc read/query) and `process_docs` (multi-doc queries). See `CLAUDE.md` for references to planning docs.
