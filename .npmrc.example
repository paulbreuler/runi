# Motion+ Token Configuration
# Copy this file to .npmrc and add your token
#
# Add your Motion+ token below (keep it commented to avoid npm warnings):
# MOTION_PLUS_TOKEN=your_token_here
#
# Or set MOTION_PLUS_TOKEN as an environment variable
#
# The setup-motion-plus.js script will automatically read the token from
# .npmrc (even from comments) or environment variable and inject it into
# package.json during setup.
